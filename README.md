The Parking System Management project is designed to manage a parking lot using Verilog. It includes modules for:
- Tracking available parking slots.
- Managing vehicle entry and exit.
- Displaying real-time parking status.
- Handling edge cases like full parking lots or invalid entries.

This project is ideal for learning Verilog and understanding how hardware description languages can be used to model real-world systems.
This project will be implemented on an FPGA.
